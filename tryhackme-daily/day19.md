# 🚀 Day 19 of My Security Journey  

Today was all about sharpening my skills through **CTF challenges** and diving into **web security tools**.  

---

## 🎯 picoCTF Practice  
Worked on challenges across multiple categories:  
- 🌐 **Web Exploitation** → finding flaws in how apps handle requests  
- 🔐 **Cryptography** → breaking ciphers & decoding hidden messages  
- ⚙️ **Reverse Engineering** → analyzing binaries and logic flow  
- 🕵️ **Forensics** → digging into files & metadata for clues  
- 📜 **General Skills** → command-line tricks & problem solving  
- 🧩 **Binary Exploitation** → exploring stack/memory vulnerabilities  

---

## 🛡️ TryHackMe Room  
Learned the basics of web application penetration testing:  
- Typical **workflow of a penetration tester**  
- How to intercept & analyze HTTP traffic  
- Finding common **attack surfaces** in applications  
- Hands-on guided exercises to apply knowledge  

---

## 🔍 Burp Suite  
- Intercepted & modified HTTP requests  
- Practiced with **Proxy, Repeater, Intruder** modules  
- Learned how Burp maps web apps & uncovers weaknesses  

---

## 📑 OWASP Top 10  
- Studied the **most critical web vulnerabilities**  
- Key ones: **Injection, Broken Authentication, Insecure Deserialization**  
- Reinforced why OWASP is the global benchmark for web security  

---

## ✨ Key Learnings  
- CTFs sharpen creativity & attacker mindset across domains  
- Burp Suite is a *must-have* for real-world penetration testing  
- OWASP Top 10 provides a structured foundation for web security
