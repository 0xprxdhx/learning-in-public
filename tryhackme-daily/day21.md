# 🚀 Day 21 of my Security Journey

Today I completed **Module 1 – Introduction to Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing** (Cisco Networking Academy).  
This module focused on **ethical foundations**, **structured methodologies**, and **building a safe lab** for practice.

---

## 🎯 Module 1 — Highlights

### 🔹 Understanding Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing
- Ethical hackers use the same tools as attackers **but responsibly**.  
- Goal: Find vulnerabilities before malicious actors do.  
- Validates defensive techniques & strengthens security posture.  
- Threat actors include:
  - Organized crime
  - Hacktivists
  - State-sponsored attackers
  - Insider threats

---

### 🔹 Penetration Testing Methodologies
- Importance of **methodology**:
  - Avoids scope creep
  - Provides structured, repeatable results
  - Creates clear documentation
- Types of penetration tests:
  - **Network infrastructure tests**
  - **Application-based tests**
  - **Cloud penetration testing**
- Test perspectives:
  - Black-box (unknown environment)
  - White-box (known environment)
  - Gray-box (partially known environment)
- Frameworks covered:
  - **MITRE ATT&CK**
  - **OWASP WSTG**
  - **NIST SP 800-115**
  - **OSSTMM**
  - **PTES**
  - **ISSAF**

---

### 🔹 Building Your Own Lab
- A safe lab environment is **essential before testing real systems**.  
- Lab requirements:
  - Closed/isolated network
  - Virtualized environment
  - Realistic targets & duplicate tools
  - Health monitoring & sufficient hardware
  - Multiple operating systems
  - Easy recovery method (snapshots/backups)
- Tools depend on test type:
  - **Network-based tools**
  - **Web application testing tools**
  - **Automated vulnerability scanning tools**
  - **Mobile app testing tools**

---

## 🧠 Mindset Shift
> *Methodology is a guardrail — it ensures ethical, repeatable, and credible pentests.*  
A **resilient homelab** allows experimentation without breaking production systems.

---

## ✨ Key Learnings
- Scope + Methodology = Safer and credible penetration testing.  
- Different testing perspectives give different visibility.  
- Homelabs are the backbone of ethical hacking practice.  

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps
- Build a **virtualized lab** with:
  - Multiple OS targets
  - Web application targets
  - Snapshot-driven rollback
- Align lab practice with:
  - **OWASP WSTG**
  - **NIST SP 800-115**

---

## 📌 Reflection
Day 21 was about **structure + safety**:  
- Enumerate with intent  
- Test with a framework  
- Practice in a controlled sandbox  

✔️ **Day 21 complete — on to the next module!**
