# 🚀 Day 22 of my Security Journey  

Today was a mix of hands-on challenges, labs, and structured learning — covering forensics, SQL injection testing, and professional scoping practices in penetration testing.  

---

## 🔍 Forensics & Hidden Data  
- Used `strings` in Linux to analyze a suspicious text file.  
- Leveraged **CyberChef** to decode numeric values into hidden text.  
- Key takeaway: Not all valuable information is obvious — forensic analysis requires curiosity, persistence, and the right tools.  

---

## 🛠️ SQLMap Basics (TryHackMe)  
- Completed **SQLMap: The Basics** room.  
- Learned how to:  
  - Automate SQL injection detection.  
  - Enumerate databases, tables, and columns.  
  - Extract data responsibly within defined scope.  
- **Lesson:** SQLMap is powerful, but scope and ethics come first.  

---

## 📘 Cisco Networking Academy — Ethical Hacker (Module 2)  
### Focus: **Planning & Scoping a Pentest**  
- **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC):** Reviewed regulations like PCI DSS, HIPAA, GLBA.  
- **Rules of Engagement:** Importance of timelines, communication, and authorization.  
- **Testing Approaches:** Unknown (black-box) vs. known (white-box) environments.  
- **Professionalism & Integrity:** Ethical hackers must respect confidentiality, follow scope, and maintain credibility.  

---

## ✨ Key Learnings  
- Forensics is about **finding what’s hidden** — every artifact tells a story.  
- SQLMap speeds up SQLi testing, but **responsible use is non-negotiable**.  
- A well-defined **scope** ensures efficiency, legality, and professionalism.  
- Cybersecurity = **technical skills + ethics** working together.  

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps  
- Dive deeper into **vulnerability scanning** and enumeration.  
- Apply **pentest scoping frameworks** (PTES, NIST SP 800-115) in homelab practice.  
- Keep solving forensics challenges to sharpen investigative skills.  

---

## 📌 Reflection  
Day 22 connected practical exploitation with structured planning. From uncovering hidden text to testing database security and learning about professional pentest scoping, today reinforced the blend of **technical expertise** and **ethical responsibility** needed in cybersecurity.  

✔️ **Day 22 complete — onward!**
