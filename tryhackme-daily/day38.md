## üìå Purpose & Scope

This document explains how to **research public exploits** and responsibly verify exploitability in a controlled lab or authorized engagement. It focuses on mapping disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) to public proof-of-concepts (PoCs), adapting exploits when required, and validating impact ‚Äî not on weaponizing exploits against unauthorized targets.

---

## üß† Key Concepts

* **Vulnerability vs Exploit** ‚Äî A *vulnerability* is a weakness (design/implementation/configuration). An *exploit* is code or a sequence of steps that leverages that weakness to achieve an impact (RCE, LPE, auth bypass, etc.).
* **PoC vs Weaponized Exploit** ‚Äî PoC demonstrates feasibility; weaponized exploit includes reliability/stability improvements for real-world use.
* **Version disclosure** ‚Äî Many public exploits target specific versions; accurate service/version enumeration is crucial.
* **Adaptation** ‚Äî Public exploits often need parameter changes, offsets, or environment tweaks to run against your target.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Responsible / Legal Note

Only test exploits against systems you own or where you have **explicit written authorization** (scope of engagement). Unauthorized exploitation is illegal and unethical. Always follow safe testing practices:

* Use isolated labs for destructive tests.
* Notify stakeholders before intrusive testing.
* Capture evidence and minimize impact.
* Provide remediation recommendations after verification.

---

## üåê Common Data Sources (where to research)

* **NVD / CVE feeds** ‚Äî official vulnerability descriptions
* **Exploit-DB / SearchSploit** ‚Äî large PoC repository
* **Metasploit module database** ‚Äî ready-to-run modules for many CVEs
* **Packet Storm / GitHub repos / security blogs** ‚Äî additional PoCs and writeups
* **Vendor advisories / patch notes** ‚Äî definitive version info

---

## üõ† Essential Tools

* **Recon & enumeration**

  * `nmap`, `masscan` (port/service discovery)
  * `curl`, `httpie`, browser devtools (HTTP inspection)
  * `nikto`, `gobuster` / `dirsearch` (web enumeration)
* **Exploit research**

  * `searchsploit` (local Exploit-DB search)
  * web browser + targeted queries (CVE + product + version + exploit)
* **Exploitation & verification**

  * `msfconsole` (Metasploit)
  * Python / Ruby / C compilers for custom PoCs
  * `netcat`, `socat` (listener / reverse shell)
* **Post-exploitation (lab-safe)**

  * `meterpreter`, `ssh`, `powershell` (when authorized)
* **Utilities**

  * `strings`, `gdb`, `objdump` (when adapting binaries)
  * `tcpdump`, `wireshark` (network-level analysis)

## üß≠ Exploit Research Workflow (high level)

1. **Discover & enumerate**

   * Identify live hosts/services and gather version info (banner grabbing, HTTP headers, package versions).
2. **Search for known issues**

   * Map discovered versions to CVEs via NVD/CVE searches and vendor advisories.
3. **Locate public PoCs / modules**

   * Use Exploit-DB / SearchSploit / GitHub / Metasploit to find PoCs or modules for matching CVEs.
4. **Analyze PoC**

   * Read the writeup and code to understand preconditions, required params, and impacts.
5. **Adapt & test in lab**

   * Recreate target environment in an isolated lab, adapt parameters/payloads, test exploit execution and stability.
6. **Validate impact**

   * Confirm desired effect (shell, data disclosure, privilege escalation) and capture reproducible evidence (screenshots, logs).
7. **Report & remediate**

   * Document steps, risk, and remediation (patches, config changes, mitigations).

---

## üîÅ Example Exploitation Chain (pattern)

1. **Recon**

   ```bash
   nmap -sV -p- --version-all -oA recon/target 10.10.10.5
   ```
2. **Identify vulnerable service & version**

   * Example: `Apache/2.4.49` with path traversal CVE-2021- (example pattern)
3. **Search for public PoC**

   ```bash
   searchsploit apache 2.4.49
   ```
4. **Review PoC / module**

   * Read the exploit script and prerequisites. Note required args (target URL, port, path).
5. **Test in lab**

   * Run PoC against lab instance; if PoC fails, inspect output and adjust (headers, offsets, payload encoding).
6. **Verify impact**

   * Use a controlled listener to receive reverse shell, or capture file contents for disclosure.
7. **Document**

   * Log commands, PoC source, outputs, and evidence (screenshots, output files).

> **Note:** Above is a pattern ‚Äî never paste or execute exploit code against unauthorized systems.

## ‚ö° Cheat Sheet Commands & Tips

```bash
# quick ports & services (TCP full scan would be slower)
nmap -sV -p- -T4 <target>

# fast web directory enumeration
gobuster dir -u http://<target> -w /usr/share/wordlists/...

# local exploit-db search
searchsploit "<service> <version>"

# launch Metasploit (when module exists)
msfconsole
search cve:<CVE-ID>
use exploit/<path>
set RHOST <target>
run
```

Tips:

* Save all evidence and timestamps.
* When adapting PoCs, incrementally test small changes.
* Use verbose/debug output from PoC to understand failure reasons.
* Prefer Metasploit modules when available for repeatability, but validate what the module does.

---

## üßæ Post-Exploitation & Remediation Guidance

* **Mitigation first:** Apply vendor patches, upgrade to non-vulnerable versions, or apply recommended configuration changes.
* **Temporary controls:** Network segmentation, WAF rules, access controls, and IPS signatures.
* **Hardening:** Remove unnecessary services, enforce least privilege, rotate credentials, enforce MFA.
* **Verification:** Re-scan and re-test after remediation to confirm the vulnerability is closed.
* **Reporting:** Provide reproduction steps, CVE references, evidence, and prioritization guidance (CVSS + exploit availability).
