# 🛠️ Tools & Code Analysis

This module focuses on learning how to:
1. Understand **basic scripting & software development** concepts.  
2. Use penetration testing **tools effectively**.  
3. Perform safe **code & exploit analysis**.

## 📌 1. Scripting & Software Development Basics

### What is scripting?
- Writing small programs to automate tasks.
- Speeds up penetration testing and analysis.
- Common scripting languages:
  - **Python** → networking, automation, exploit development.
  - **Bash** → system tasks, quick commands in Linux.
  - **PowerShell** → Windows automation and Active Directory testing.

### Why scripting is important?
- Makes tasks repeatable.
- Helps validate findings.
- Can build custom tools if none exist.

## 📌 2. Penetration Testing Tools — Use Cases

Penetration testers use different tools depending on the phase of the test:

- **Reconnaissance**
  - `Nmap`, `Recon-ng`
- **Exploitation**
  - `Metasploit`, custom proof-of-concept scripts
- **Post-Exploitation**
  - `Mimikatz`, `BloodHound`
- **Code Analysis**
  - `Ghidra`, `Radare2`, `IDA Free`

👉 Key Point: Always understand **why** you are using a tool before running it.

## 📌 3. Analyzing Exploit Code

### 3.1 Static Analysis (without running code)
- Read source code or binary safely.
- Look for:
  - Suspicious functions (`exec`, `eval`, `os.system`).
  - Hardcoded credentials, URLs, tokens.
  - Unsafe input handling.
- Tools: `strings`, `readelf`, `objdump`.

### 3.2 Dynamic Analysis (running code in a lab)
- Run the code in a **controlled environment** (VM snapshot).
- Monitor:
  - System calls (`strace`, `ltrace`).
  - Network activity (`tcpdump`, `wireshark`).
- Collect logs and outputs as evidence.

⚠️ **Never run unknown code outside a secure lab.**

---

## 📌 4. Ethics & Safety

- Do not run exploits on production systems.
- Always test in **isolated labs** with snapshots.
- Follow **responsible disclosure** when handling vulnerabilities.
- Document clearly — avoid unnecessary PoC use in reports.

---

## 📌 5. Key Takeaways

- ✅ Scripting helps automate and reproduce results.  
- ✅ Tools serve different roles — choose the right one.  
- ✅ Exploit code should be studied with caution.  
- ✅ Static first, dynamic only in controlled labs.  
- ✅ Findings must be documented in clear, actionable reports.
