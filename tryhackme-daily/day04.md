# Cybersecurity Journey (Networking + Nmap Practice)
## 🧠 What I Studied:

### 🔍 TryHackMe: Networking Concepts Room
- Learned core **networking fundamentals**:
  - **OSI Model** – 7-layer abstraction of data flow in a network.
  - **TCP/IP Suite** – 4-layer real-world implementation model.
- Explored **Telnet** – remote terminal protocol used for connecting and managing remote devices.

## 🛠️ Practical Skills

### 🌐 Shodan.io – Real-World Target Practice
- **What is Shodan?**  
  Shodan is a search engine that indexes internet-connected devices and services, exposing public IPs, open ports, banners, and vulnerabilities.
- Found IPs with exposed services.
- Used **Nmap** to scan selected targets from Shodan.
- Practiced identifying open ports and potential entry points.
- Tested **Telnet** connections on open ports.
