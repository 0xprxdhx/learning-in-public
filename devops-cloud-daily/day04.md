Cloud Journey (Foundations + AWS Infrastructure)

## 📌 What I Learned:

### 🌐 Cloud Computing Fundamentals
- Understood what **Cloud Computing** is and how it's different from Traditional IT.
- Explored the **3 cloud service models**:
  - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** – e.g., AWS EC2
  - **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** – e.g., Heroku
  - **SaaS (Software as a Service)** – e.g., Gmail, Dropbox
- Summarized each model to understand how businesses use them.

### ☁️ Cloud Deployment Models
- Learned about **Public, Private, Hybrid, and Community Clouds**.
- Compared their **advantages, use cases**, and key differences.
- Noted real-world applications of each deployment model.

### 🌍 AWS Global Infrastructure
- Learned how **AWS divides its global network** using:
  - **Regions**
  - **Availability Zones (AZs)**
  - **Edge Locations**
- Understood why **multi-AZ setups** are critical for high availability and fault tolerance.
- Drew an AWS infrastructure diagram to visualize the architecture.
